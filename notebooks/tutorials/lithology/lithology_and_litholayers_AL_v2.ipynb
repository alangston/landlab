    "# Introduction to the Lithology and LithoLayers objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Lithology and LithoLayers are two Landlab components meant to make it easier to work with spatially variable lithology that produces spatially variable parameter values (e.g. stream power erodability or diffusivity). \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is meant for users who have some experience using Landlab components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explore the creation of spatially variable lithology and its impact on the evolution of topography. After an introductory example that will let you see how LithoLayers works, we will work through two more complicated examples. In the first example, we use the LithoLayers to erode either dipping layeres or an anticline. Then we will use Lithology to create inverted topography. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) to store and annotate our model output. While we won't extensively discuss the use of xarray, some background will be provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we will import the necessary modules. A note: this tutorial uses the [HoloViews package](http://holoviews.org) for visualization. This package is a great tool for dealing with multidimentional annotated data (e.g. an xarray dataset). If you get an error on import, consider updating dask (this is what the author needed to do in April 2018). You will also need to have the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) packages installed.\n",

    "In testing we've seen some users have a warning raised related to the Matplotlib backend. In our testing it was OK to ignore these errors. "

    "## Part 1: Creating layered rock\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will create an instance of a LithoLayers to learn how this component works. Both LithoLayers and Lithology work closely with a Landlab ModelGrid, storing information about rock type at each grid node. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create LithoLayers you need the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A model grid that has the field `'topographic__elevation'` already created. \n",
    "2. A list of elevations, called `'layer_elevations'` that the bottom of your layers will go through at specified plan-view anchor point (default value for the anchor point is (x, y) = (0, 0)), and a list of rock type IDs that indicate the rock type of that layer. When `'layer_elevations'` is negative that means that the layer goes through the anchor point above the topographic surface. These layers will be created where they extend below the topographic surface.\n",
    "3. A dictionary of rock property attributes that maps a rock ID type to property values.\n",
    "4. A functional form in x and y that defines the shape of your surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of this function form makes it possible for any function of x and y to be passed to LithoLayers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Lithology and LithoLayers components then know the rock type ID of all the material in the 'block of rock' you have specified. This can be used to continuously know the value of specified rock properties at the topographic surface, even as the rock is eroded, uplifted, or new rock is deposited. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will first make an example to help build intuition and then do two more complex examples. Most of the functionality of Lithology and LithoLayers is shown in this tutorial, but if you want to read the full component documentation for LithoLayers, it can be found [here](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/release/landlab.components.lithology.html).

    "[xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) allows us to create a container for our data and label it with information like units, dimensions, short and long names, etc.  xarray gives all the tools for dealing with N-dimentional data provided by python packages such as [numpy](http://www.numpy.org), the labeling and named indexing power of the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) package, and the data-model of the [NetCDF file](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can use xarray to make a \"self-referential\" dataset that contains all of the variables and attributes that describe what each part is and how it was made. In this application, we won't make a fully self-referential dataset, but if you are interested in this, check out the [NetCDF best practices](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/BestPractices.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Important for our application is that later on we will use the [HoloViews package](http://holoviews.org) for visualization. This package is a great tool for dealing with multidimentional annotated data and will do things like automatically create nice axis labels with units. However, in order for it to work, we must first annotate our data to include this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we create an xarray Dataset with two variables `'topographic__elevation'` and `'rock_type__id'` and three dimensions `'x'`, `'y'`, and `'time'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We pass xarray two dictionaries, one with information about the data variabiables (`data_vars`) and one with information about the coordinate system (`coords`). For each data variable or coordinate, we pass a tuple of three items: `(dims, data, atts)`. The first element is a tuple of the name of the dimensions, the second element is the data, an the third is a dictionary of attributes. "

    "Next, we run the model. In each time step we first run the FlowAccumulator to direct flow and accumulatate drainage area. Then the FastscapeEroder erodes the topography based on the stream power equation using the erodability value in the field `'K_sp'`. We create an uplift field that uplifts only the model grid's core nodes. After uplifting these core nodes, we update LithoLayers. Importantly, we must tell the LithoLayers how it has been advected upward by uplift using the `dz_advection` keyword argument. \n",

    "As we discussed in the introductory example, the built-in function [`lith.run_one_step`](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/release/landlab.components.litholayers.html#landlab.components.lithology.litholayers.LithoLayers.run_one_step) has an optional keyword argument `rock_id` to use when some material may be deposited. The LithoLayers component needs to know what type of rock exists everywhere and it will raise an error if material is deposited **and** no rock type is specified. However, here we are using the FastscapeEroder which is fully detachment limited, and thus we know that no material will be deposited at any time. Thus we can ignore this keyword argument. Later in the tutorial we will use the LinearDiffuser which can deposit sediment and we will need to set this keyword argument correctly. \n",

    "## Part 3: Creation of Inverted Topography\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will explore making inverted topography by eroding Lithology with constant properties for half of the model evaluation time, and then filling Lithology in with resistant material only where the drainage area is large. This is meant as a simple example of filling in valleys with volcanic material. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the details of the options for creating a [Lithology](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/release/landlab.components.lithology.html) can be found here. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next code block we make a new model and run it. There are a few important differences between this next example and the one we just worked through in Part 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will have two rock types. Type `0` that represents non-volcanic material. It will have a higher diffusivity and erodability than the volcanic material, which is type `1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in Part 2 we did not specify a `rock_id` keyword argument to the `lith.run_one_step` method. This was because we used only the FastscapeEroder component which is fully detachment limited and thus never deposits material. In this example we will also use the LinearDiffuser component, which may deposity material. The `Lithology` component needs to know the rock type everywhere and thus we must indicate the rock type of the newly deposited rock. This is done by passing a single value or number-of-nodes sized array rock type values to the `run_one_step` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also are handling the model grid boundary conditions differently than in the last example, setting the boundaries on the top and bottom to closed. "
